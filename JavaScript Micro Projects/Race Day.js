// Race Day
/*  write a program that will register runners for the race and give them instructions on race day. Hereâ€™s how our registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.
Race number:
Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
All others receive a number below 1000.
Start time:
Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
Early adults run at 9:30 am.
Late adults run at 11:00 am.
Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).
